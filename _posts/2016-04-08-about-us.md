SCHOOL BACKGROUND

2015 is Dancemore's 25th Anniversary and we are extremely proud of this achievement. We therefore, wish to thank all our students, past and present for your support in making these 25 years so memorable . We hope to continue for at least another 25 , when we can all, then celebrate 50 fantastic dance years together.

Once again, THANK YOU ALL FOR YOU LOYAL SUPPORT.

As mentioned,the school has been going for 25 years and our group classes are immensely popular. Our classes are purely social (non competitive) and are lots of fun. Although the standard of teaching (training/methods etc) is very high, classes are friendly and relaxed.

We make the guys feel really welcome and they are often surprised to find that they enjoy the classes a lot!!
Our specialities are new beginners (you know, the ones with 5 left feet!) and teaching the men how to lead and the ladies how to follow.

We teach you all the Ballroom and Latin American dances, with the emphasis being more on Latin American. The aim is for couples to be able to dance socially and comfortably at any function - from informal parties to business or wedding functions, looking and feeling natural and comfortable on the dance floor.

Although most students accomplish all their dancing needs during group classes, occasionally a couple may wish to book private lessons to check their lead and follow techniques or to prepare for a special occasion like a wedding.
